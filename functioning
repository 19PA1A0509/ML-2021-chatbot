The functioning of mimi seems to be simple but is a very intresting one.

1.she greets you according to time and asks for your name.
You'll have to give your name as input.
Then she says what are the tasks she can perform.
Then you must choose what you want to do with her.

2. (Happiness lies in the little things..right?)
If you want to see how many days old are you
She asks you to give your birthday in yyyy/mm/dd format
and when you proceed, she calculates in her brain..i.e, memory and gives you the output.

3.if you want to know the day you are born
Mimi asks you for your birthday
and when you give it she sees her calendar and gives you the day you were born.

4. And if you are too bored and have no one to play with..you can play handcricket with her
first you'll have to choose between batting or bowling
if you choose to bat
you have to give a score of 1-6 in each ball for 10 balls and either does she.
if your inputs coincide, you'll be out or else at the end who has the highest score wins
the same goes with the bowling
if your inputs coincide,she'll be the looser or else 
winner is declared by adding up the scores.

you may play with her until you are bored.
