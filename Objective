This is a small and friendly chatbot. Her name is "mimi". Her main objective is to cure the boredom of the user.

She has 3 games
1. says how many days old you are
2. says the day on which you were born
3. plays hand cricket with you

In the 1st game you'll be very excited to know how old you are in days 
in the 2nd you might know one of the suprising things which you might not have noticed till date.

you may think the first 2 are intresting but in 3 rd one is a bit entertaining and is similar to the one which you played in childhood
with your friends. With your friends you may have cheated by seeing their hand gestures.. but mimi is a tough girl. 

If you want to win you must try hard. However there are no tosses in the game and you can choose batting or bowling upon your intrest.
